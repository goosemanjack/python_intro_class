# Python Class 4
In this class we further explore code organization through the use of classes and objects.

Class definitions operate as an encapsulation "template" by which you can logically
group attributes and methods into a single code object.

## Homework
Use the concept of Class to create a Class for your adventurer.
This class can hold name, equipment, status, skills, hit points, etc.

### Bonus
Create other classes for things like rooms and items. Make use of multiple instances
to simplify your code.
