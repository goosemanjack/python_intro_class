# Python Class 2
In this class we start to explore the interactive interpreter, control flow structures, and code organization.


## Class 2 Goals

1. Use the interactive Python console to test simple statements
  * Open a command prompt and launch Python
  * Assign and use variables
  * Print output
  * Perform literal math operations
  * Exit the interpreter with exit()
  * Open terminal within Visual Studio Code
  * Launch and use py interpreter in VS Code
2. Execute a saved python script from command line.
  * Write a hello world program
  * Execute the script from command line
3. Capturing input from the user
  * Modify hello to ask for user name
  * Change output to utilize this value
4. Write and understand control flow
  * If statements
  * Looping
5. Modify your program to accept input and make decisions
  * Present decision based on 1, 2, or 3 to represent a value
  * Assess and handle exceptions
  * Cast values to desired type
6. Function definitions and organization
  * Add a second question as a function
  * Wrap entire program in functions
  * Pass parameters to functions

## Homework
Create a simple "Choose your own Adventure" program with at least three different questions and outcome paths. Utilize functions and control flow.

Ideas for topics:
* D&D campaign
* Dog training and behaviors
* Pick someone else's adventure and code it to a program.

Please submit your program via email (copy/paste) to me goosemanjack@gmail.com prior to Tuesday.
