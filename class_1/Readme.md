# Intro to Python Class 1
## Prerequisites and Intro
Welcome to introduction to computer programming in Python!
 
The first step before we begin our course is to configure your development environment. We are a Windows household, so the provided links are specific to Windows systems. I'm going to try using video conferencing for instruction, and lots of hands on with yourself. We are at the "hello world" level to begin.
 
Download and install the following three items: Python interpreter, Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in the form of Visual Studio Code, and the Python extensions for said IDE from the final link.
 
Part of being a software developer is the suffering of figuring out how to do all of this from poor documentation. I am here to help, but cannot promise I will be nice. For the first three years of my career I estimated the mean average of attempts to install all software on a new developer machine was 3 over 3-5 days. Things have improved, but suffering brings knowledge. Expect to have to do the initial steps more than once to make things work!
