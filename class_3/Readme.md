# Intro to Python Class 3

We will further examine structuring of code by using modules and imports. We will also utilize some built-in modules to get more extensive behavior.

## Class 3 Goals

1. New program. Import a built-in module and use a sound
2. Create a module library to hold useful functions
3. Restructure a story for logical separation
4. Explore new data types:
  * Tuple
  * Set
  * Dictionary
5. Bonus: Refactor for reuse

## Homework
The homework will be to take your "Choose your own Adventure" program and break it apart into separate modules and make use of built-in module functions.

* Make a copy of your program for extension
* Break your code into multiple modules
* Add some ascii artwork to places in your story
* Add sound to story points

Please submit your program via email (copy/paste) to me goosemanjack@gmail.com prior to next Tuesday April 7th.
